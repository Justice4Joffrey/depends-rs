/// A Hash of the current node state used to signal whether a dependent node
/// needs to update its internal state.
///
/// Every edge in a `depends` graph tracks the previously observed `NodeHash` of
/// the child node and signals to the dependee whether this has _changed_ since
/// the last run using the [IsDirty](crate::execution::IsDirty) trait.
/// This is used to cache internal computations.
///
/// # NotHashed
///
/// If `NotHashed` is used, dependent nodes will *never* consider previously
/// observed states equal and will therefore update their internal state
/// _every time_ they're resolved. For this reason, it's recommended that
/// `NotHashed` be used sparingly (in cases where computing a hash of a node's
/// state is impossible or costlier than recomputing the dependee's state).
///
/// Whichever implementation is chosen, it's important to structure graphs so
/// that the number of nodes and edges _to_ nodes implementing `NotHashed` is
/// kept to a minimum, especially where performance is a concern.
///
